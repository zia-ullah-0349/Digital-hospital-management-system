# Digital-hospital-management-system
​1. Project Overview
​Project Title: Digital Patient and Appointment Management System using C++.  
​Course: Programming Fundamentals, Fall 2025 (1st semester).  
​Team: Ishal Ahmad (Roll 14), Zia Ullah (Roll 23), and Sameer Ahmad (Roll 33).  
​Session: Morning.  
​2. Problem Statement & Goals
​The Issue: Hospitals often struggle with manual or fragmented systems for managing patient data, appointments, and billing, leading to inefficiency and errors.  
​The Solution: A console-based Hospital Management System (HMS) to automate processes, ensure secure record-keeping, and improve data integrity.  
​3. Technical Objectives
​The project aims to utilize specific C++ programming concepts:
​Core Concepts: Using loops for menus, conditional statements for logins, and user-defined functions for modularity.  
​File I/O: Implementing robust operations to store and load data (patients, appointments, bills) from text files for persistence.  
​Data Structures: Using std::vector for dynamic storage and management of records.  
​4. Scope of Work
​The system will be a fully functional console application featuring:
​User Authentication: A login system with a username and password.  
​Patient & Medical Records: Creating and storing patient profiles and basic medical histories linked by a unique ID.  
​Scheduling & Billing: Tools to manage appointments and track payment status (PAID/UNPAID).  
​5. System Design & Logic
​Initialization: The program starts by loading all existing data from files into vectors.  
​Operations: Users interact through an Administration Panel to perform tasks like adding patients or processing bills.  
​Persistence: To ensure data is not lost, the system calls a save function immediately after any data modification and upon exiting the program.  
​6. Tools
​Language: C++.  
​IDEs: Visual Studio, CodeBlocks, DevC++, or VS Code.
